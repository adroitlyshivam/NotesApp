# NotesApp

*The app is not actively developed since I have deviated from Android development in recent years.
I'll fix critical bugs, but features may not be implemented before a very long time, if ever. 
Expect one release per year. I will accept and review pull requests though.*

This is a simple Android app for taking notes, like there have been tens of thousands before.
The app has Material UI, was built following MVVM architecture, uses Dagger and some Jetpack
components.  
 

#### Features
- Text and list notes.
- Archive and recycle bin.
- Labeled notes.
- Reminders (including recurring).
- Searching notes.
- Light and dark theme support.
- Basic import and export.
- Somewhat customizable interface.
